# Lumiére Dining - TESTING

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of this section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/Found-In-Translation/blob/main/TESTING.md#found-in-translation----testing-documentation)

Add an image of the finished site here. I like to use [amiresponsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive) to get an image of my site on all device sizes, and amiresponsive allows you to click links on the page and scroll, so each device can show a different element of your site.

Add a link to the live site here, for Milestone 1 this will be the GitHub Pages Link from when you deployed the site.

If you want to add optional shields.io badges to your TESTING file, I like to add them to this section (Shields.io have some badges for W3C validation which makes it easy to see at a glance whether the project has passed validation).

## AUTOMATED TESTING

The Automated Testing includes all the testing that is carried out by a program, like W3C HTML validation.

###  W3C Validator

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed W3C HTML & CSS validation section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms/blob/main/TESTING.md#W3C-Validator)

The most popular HTML validator is [W3C](https://validator.w3.org/). There are two ways to validate the HTML for your first milestone - you can copy the live link for your site page and paste into the validate by URI field, or you can copy all the code for your page and paste this into the validate by direct input field.

#### **URI Input**

If you validate with your sites URL, you can run the validation and then copy the link from the address bar and insert the link here as your proof of validation.

#### **Direct Input**

If you validate with the code, you will need to screenshot the validation results and then link the image here.

#### **CSS Validation**

CSS Validation can only be done by copying and pasting the CSS file contents into the direct input. Make sure that the checkbox for CSS is selected.

### Lighthouse

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed lighthouse testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#Lighthouse)

Lighthouse Testing is part of the Chrome Developer Tools. For more information on how to use this tool, please visit [chrome Lighthouse](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lighthouse/blipmdconlkpinefehnmjammfjpmpbjk?hl=en#:~:text=Lighthouse%20is%20an%20open%2Dsource,how%20well%20the%20page%20did.).

You will need to run the Lighthouse testing on each individual page of your site, for desktop as a minimum. If you have time it would be great to also add in the mobile testing.

### WAVE

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed WAVE testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/earth-day-hackathon-2022/blob/main/TESTING.md#WAVE)

[WAVE](https://wave.webaim.org/) is an accessibility testing tool. I like to run this on each page of my site and take a screenshot of the results to add here. They have a website for testing and a Chrome extension.

## MANUAL TESTING

### Testing User Stories

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed user stories testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/blob/main/TESTING.md#Testing-User-Stories)

This is where you will test the user stories you created in the README against your site. I like to use a table for this section - I create a column for the user stories goals, how these have been achieved and I use the third column to add any supporting images.

### Full Testing

👩🏻‍💻 View an example of a completed full testing section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/TheQuizArms/blob/main/TESTING.md#Full-Testing)

Full testing can be tedious, so it is great to try and break this part up into smaller chunks and do a bit at a time. Full testing is when you go through the site and test every single thing that can be tested. So for example you would test that all links in the navbar correctly redirect the user to where there are supposed to go. A table is the perfect way to display this information.

## BUGS

### Known Bugs

List (or put in a table) all known bugs on your site here as soon as you find them. This will prevent you from forgetting any at the end. Some (if not all) of these bugs will hopefully make their way over to the next section, solved bugs, as you progress through your project.

### Solved Bugs

👩🏻‍💻View an example of a completed bugs section [here](https://github.com/kera-cudmore/BookWorm/blob/main/TESTING.md#BUGS)

This is where all solved bugs go once squashed. List what the bug was, and how you managed to fix it. You can also include images/videos here if you wanted.
